- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
<<<<<<< HEAD

In the Cafe class I decided to overload the constructor to take in no arguments and just the name of the Cafe because I feel like most likely you would know the name of the cafe or nothing about it. Also in the Cafe class I overloaded the printInventory() method to just print the inventory of a certain item. In the House class I overloaded the constructor to take in no arguments or just the name of the House for the same reason that I overloaded the cafe constructor. For the Library class I overloaded the constructor to take in no arguments so you can just create a general library. I also overloaded the printCollection() method so if you put in either available or unavailable it will show you only the books that are available or only the books that are not available. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Overall this assignment went pretty smooth for me. The only time I ran into some trouble was when I had to override the goToFloor() method in the House class and overloading the printCollection() method in the Library class. So the advice I would give someone taking this course is to challenge yourself when deciding which methods to override, it will help you and be more satisfying in the long run.
